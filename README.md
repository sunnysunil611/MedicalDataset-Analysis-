Welcome to my HiCounselor Projects Repository! Here, you'll find a collection of real-world projects I've completed, designed to solve practical problems and build coding confidence.

## Projects

### [Statistical Loan Analysis for Risk Mitigation and Client Solvency using SQL](https://github.com/SQLicious/HiCounselor-Real-World-Projects/tree/main/Loan%20Analysis/Inputs)


#### Overview
Dive into the world of Fintech with this project! Explore the intricacies of predicting creditworthiness, tailoring loan terms, and minimizing default rates using SQL queries. Get insights into the factors determining loan approval and rejection.


#### Approach
- Cleaned up 82,708 records with Python and Pandas.
- Loaded cleaned data into an SQL database.
- Explored loan statistics, job impact on borrowing, repayment duration, borrower ratings, and homeownership influence on loan approval.

#### Coolest Findings
- Basic loan stats: counts, average interest rates, highs, and lows of loan amounts.
- Impact of job on borrowing capacity.
- Loan repayment duration and status analysis.
- Ratings and the role of homeownership in loan approval.

#### Achievements
Successfully completing the Statistical Loan Analysis project within two days of its December 2023 launch, I secured a top rank on the leaderboard. Unbeknownst to me, by the end of the one-week project period, a total of 1500 participants had attempted this challenge


### [Jan 2024 Project: Medical Dataset Analysis - Using Python and SQL](https://github.com/SQLicious/HiCounselor-Real-World-Projects/tree/main/Medical%20Dataset%20Analysis)

#### Overview
Welcome to the Healthcare Data Analysis project, focusing on three essential datasets: "hospitalization_details," "medical_examinations," and "names." The project consists of two main modules:

### 1. Data Cleaning:
I used Python to enhance data accuracy and structure, ensuring the datasets are well-prepared for meaningful analysis and extracting valuable insights. These steps were performed on hospitalization_detailscsv and medical_examinations.csv files


### 2. SQL-Powered Insights:
In the second module, utilize SQL queries to extract insightful information from the refined datasets. Delve into healthcare data to facilitate informed decision-making and optimize resource allocation in the healthcare sector.


#### Approach
- Cleaned up hospitalization_details.csv (2432 rows × 11 columns) and medical_examinations.csv (2343 rows × 9 columns) with Python and Pandas.

   [Click here to explore the code](https://github.com/SQLicious/HiCounselor-Real-World-Projects/blob/main/Medical%20Dataset%20Analysis/Coding/Medical%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)  I used to clean these datasets:
  
- Loaded cleaned data into MySQL database through phpAdmin access provided by Hicounselor
- **Explored these key Business Questions:**
  - List of Customers with Major Surgeries
  - Average Charges per Hospital Tier in 2000
  - Customer with the Highest Number of Major Surgeries
  - Average BMI for Each City Tier in 1995
  - Customers with Health Issues and BMI > 30
  - Customer with the Highest Total Charges Each Year
  - Top 3 Customers with Highest Average Yearly Charges
  - Rank Customers Based on Total Charges
  - Year with the Highest Number of Hospitalizations
  - Identify Customers with Significant Medical History

#### Benefits:

- Gain practical experience in data cleaning techniques for healthcare datasets.
- Enhance proficiency in SQL queries for extracting meaningful insights from three different medical datasets.
- Develop understanding healthcare domain by driving data-driven solutions.
-  Illuminate the path to actionable insights, shaping the future of healthcare analytics.

#### Key Findings
- The average hospital charge per admission across all patients is $13,559.
- Top 3 Customers with Highest Average Yearly Charges: Ms. Kelly Hawks had the highest average yearly hospital charges at $63,770, followed by Mr. Matthew Lehner at $62,592 and Mr. Phil Lu at $60,021.
- Tier 3 hospitals average approximately $4,673.12, Tier 2 hospitals around $8,915.94, and Tier 1 hospitals have the highest average charge at $35,367.44. This information can be valuable for healthcare planning, resource allocation, and understanding the financial landscape of hospitals in different tiers 

- 26 high-risk patients were identified who smoke, had transplants, and were hospitalized, incurring over $800K in charges.Targeted smoking cessation and weight management programs could potentially improve health outcomes and reduce costs

- 488 patients with health issues and a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than 30, along with associated hospitalization charges. Customers with obesity and health problems tend to have greater healthcare utilization and costs.

- 687 patients were identified as having 2+ major surgeries or cancer history, indicating complex medical needs.These individuals likely require more intensive care coordination and management due to their conditions.
